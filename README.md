# HackerRank Solutions

Welcome! This repository is where I keep my solutions to various HackerRank challenges. Instead of treating this like a code dump, I’m using it as a place to show how I think, how I write code, and how I approach problems.

I solve these challenges to sharpen my fundamentals, improve my coding style, and maintain good habits like testing and documenting — even for small exercises.

## What's inside

The repo is organised by language and topic:

    hackerrank-solutions/
    ├── python/
    │   ├── algorithms/
    │   ├── data_structures/
    │   └── others/
    ├── sql/
    └── tests/

Each problem folder usually includes:

- A clean, commented solution
- A short explanation of the idea behind it
- Time/space complexity
- (Sometimes) alternative approaches

## What I focus on

Even though HackerRank challenges can be solved quickly, I try to treat each one like real code:

### Readable, maintainable structure
Small functions, type hints, meaningful names — code that you can actually read without squinting.

### Clear explanations
Each solution has a short summary written in my own words (no copyrighted problem statements).

### Tests where it makes sense
I use pytest for Python solutions so I can validate logic without manually typing inputs every time.

### GitLab CI ready
The repo can run automated tests on every commit.

## Running the code

### Clone the repo

    git clone <your-gitlab-repo-url>
    cd hackerrank-solutions

### Run tests

    pip install pytest
    pytest

### Or run individual Python scripts

    python path/to/file.py

## Work in progress

I’m constantly adding new solutions and occasionally revisiting older ones to improve them — whether that means refactoring, adding tests, or rewriting them with a better approach.

This repo is meant to show my progression over time, not perfection on day one.

## Notes

- Problem descriptions are paraphrased out of respect for HackerRank’s copyright.
- All solutions are written by me.
- Feedback and PRs are welcome if you spot ways to improve things.
